CHENGELOG REPRODUCTION SIMULATOR

v1.0.1

- Fixed a critical issue with the death counter within the simulation:
  whenever a member of the population reproduced itself, it was not checked whether it died too,
	resulting in a surplus of the overall population for each period

v1.1

- Added the possibility to change the default values while running.

  Default values set:

    default_Starting_N = int(50)

    default_Period = int(30)

    default_b = float(0.2)

    default_d = float(0.1)

    default_c = float(0.001)

    default_Repeat = int(30)

- Added the length of Period in the results presentation

v1.2

- Refactoring results presentation:
  the changes introduced provide with more meaningful data visualization about the variation of the Delta Population, in particular:

  - A new plot is included showing the theoretical curve of Delta Population as a function of the Population over a histogram of the actual mean values obtained during the simulations
  
  - More data about the numbers obtained during the simulations are printed out in tables at the end of the execution
    (EVOLUTION: data can be exported)
