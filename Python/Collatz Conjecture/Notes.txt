Notes about Collatz Conjecture program

- Presentation window DONE

- User input DONE

	- The input defines the range of starting numbers to compute the Collatz Conjecture for DONE

	- Consider to adapt to the application (check if second input is higher than first, beyond being integers) DONE

- Computation DONE

- Graph presentation (must be done later to know the maximum values for the axis) DONE

	- X: Iterations (1 - Max_Iterations) DONE

	- Y: Numbers obtained (1 - Max Number) DONE

- Data insights DONE

- Data export DONE

	- Needs refactoring because data cannot be plotted if saved in array format DONE

		- By modifying normalizeValues(), the generation of graphs might be affected --> Apply modifications to Excel output first DONE

		- Complete refactoring --> To generate graphs I need an array: there is no point on deleting the "Obtained Values" array until the user decides to export data DONE

- Analyze warnings to optimize code

	- If "Obtained Values" can be converted into a DataFrame ("Iteration 1", ..., "Iteration n"), it should be possible to merge them to the original DataFrame DONE

- Consider reworking data ax2.plot axis --> The highest number of iteration might have a very low maximum number resulting in poor graph visualization DONE

- Consider UI design eventually
