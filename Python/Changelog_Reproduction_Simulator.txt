CHENGELOG REPRODUCTION SIMULATOR

v1.0.1

- Fixed a critical issue with the death counter within the simulation:
  whenever a member of the population reproduced itself, it was not checked whether it died too,
	resulting in a surplus of the overall population for each period

v1.1

- Added the possibility to change the default values while running.

  Default values set:

    default_Starting_N = int(50)

    default_Period = int(30)

    default_b = float(0.2)

    default_d = float(0.1)

    default_c = float(0.001)

    default_Repeat = int(30)

- Added the length of Period in the results presentation

v1.2

- Tables' types redefinition:
  N_Tab and D_Tab have been refactored through Pandas DataFrame module, so it is now easier to collect data and run computations

- A new plot is included showing the theoretical curve of Delta Population as a function of the Population compared to the actual mean values obtained during the simulations

  - Can be disabled to shorten the expected time of execution

v1.3 (TBD)

- Managed typeExceptions due to certain incorrect user inputs

- The results of the simulation can now be exported in a single .xlsx file (and/or in .csv?)

- The presentation ot the results has been rethinked and is now showing more and more meaningful results
