CHENGELOG REPRODUCTION SIMULATOR

V1.0.1

- Fixed a critical issue with the death counter within the simulation:
  whenever a member of the population reproduced itself, it was not checked whether it died too,
	resulting in a surplus of the overall population for each period

V1.1

- Added the possibility to change the default values while running.

  Default values set:

    default_Starting_N = int(50)

    default_Period = int(30)

    default_b = float(0.2)

    default_d = float(0.1)

    default_c = float(0.001)

    default_Repeat = int(30)
