Notes about Collatz Conjecture program

- Presentation window DONE

- User input DONE

	- The input defines the range of starting numbers to compute the Collatz Conjecture for DONE

	- Consider to adapt to the application (check if second input is higher than first, beyond being integers)

- Computation

- Graph presentation

	- X: iterations

	- Y: starting number

- Data insights

- Data export

- Consider UI design eventually
