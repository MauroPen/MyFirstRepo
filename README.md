# MyPythonRepo

Welcome to MyPythonRepo!

This is my first repo where I upload little Python projects to learn this coding language and the basics of Git.

The code is organized in two folders:

- src: contains all the source code, including _main.py_
- tests: contains _unit tests_ for specific modules

Please, run _main.py_ to try the software.

Feel free to have a look and text me if you have comments or suggestions!
