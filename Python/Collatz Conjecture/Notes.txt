Notes about Collatz Conjecture program

- Presentation window DONE

- User input DONE

	- The input defines the range of starting numbers to compute the Collatz Conjecture for DONE

	- Consider to adapt to the application (check if second input is higher than first, beyond being integers) DONE

- Computation DONE

- Graph presentation (must be done later to know the maximum values for the axis)

	- X: Iterations (1 - Max_Iterations)

	- Y: Numbers obtained (1 - Max Number)

- Data insights

- Data export

- Consider UI design eventually
